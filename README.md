## Part 1 
### The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with ten variables for each patient. The analysis includes identifying column types, handling null values, and understanding the data through statistical measures. The findings reveal that most continuous attributes have single-model distributions, except for "age" and "adiposity" which have multimodal distributions. There are no null values, but some columns have zero values. The oldest and youngest patients are 64 and 15 years old, respectively. Age is correlated with the presence of heart disease, and the youngest age group has the highest survival rate. Various visualizations are used to understand relationships between columns. The data is preprocessed, scaled, and undergoes logistic regression modeling. The model achieves 82% accuracy, and a Voting Classifier further improves accuracy to 83% by combining multiple models. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the heart disease dataset, emphasizing the importance of preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.

## Part 2
### In conclusion, this report presents a complete analysis of the property dataset with various types of columns. The dataset is fully explored, and crucial insights are derived. The 'price' column is examined in detail to understand its distribution and its relation with other attributes. Hypothesis tests are performed to understand the impact of the year a property was built in, on its sale price. A covariance matrix is constructed to identify the principal components of the dataset, and its inverse and rank are calculated to assess their impacts on linear regression problems. Finally, a linear system of equations is solved to establish relationships between selected features and the 'price'. This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing property prices and can help real estate investors. The scatter plot and regression line offer a visual representation of these relationships, further enhancing our understanding of the dataset.
